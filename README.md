# terraform-learning
These are basic examples of terraform deployments used for demos and customer training sessions. 

Folder Descriptions
- docker:  folder contains dockerfiles to help those getting started with Terraform.
- vmware-example - VM Creation and Cloning Examples with Terraform
- 202106-Demo - ACI Configuration Demo Example

Most of these examples require user assistance and were not intended to be given to customers without some assistance and discussion about how these work. They are not working models. They are basic methods I use with customers to help them understand basic Terraform concepts.
